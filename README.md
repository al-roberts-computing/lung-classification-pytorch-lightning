# Lung Classification using PyTorch Lightning and EfficientNetB0
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook containing code for downloading a COVID dataset on Kaggle, then classifying the 4 categories of images. This is accomplished using the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 network.

PyTorch Lightning is a scalable Machine Learning framework which simplifies and helps better organise model development.
